Nidhogg is a multi-functional rootkit to showcase the variety of operations that can be done from kernel space. The goal of Nidhogg is to provide an all-in-one and easy-to-use rootkit with multiple helpful functionalities for operations. Besides that, it can also easily be integrated with your C2 framework.

Nidhogg can work on any version of x64 Windows 10 and Windows 11.

This repository was made as part of the integration with [Athena](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Athena) - A cross-platform C# [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) agent created by [checkymander](https://github.com/checkymander). This repository contains a C# API to communicate with Nidhogg (can be used with any tool or C2, Mythic was my choice to integrate with).
